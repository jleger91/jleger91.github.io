## Professional Self-Assessment
My time at Southern New Hampshire University has helped to shape my professional goals and values; I am now prepared to join the workforce in the tech industry and if not then I will continue sharpening my skills. This portfolio is not a complete showcase of my work although it shows my ability to plan and develop industry-standard code.
